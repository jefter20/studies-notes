#### 1.2.1 - Introduction 

The 20th century was marked by dizzying social, service and industrial progress, reflecting the development of technology. 

At that time, development was almost always linear, that is, the car would become faster, the telephone smaller, or an airplane would become bigger. This generated predictions that turned out to be wrong, because development has become non-linear. The globalization, the interaction between things, people and services has created a scenario of ultra-competitiveness, of great speed of change, inventions and disruptive creations, of great ideas and technological products. This movement also created products that proved to be of little use and fell into disuse, such as Windows Phone, Xbox kinect, Blu-ray, 3D TV, etc.

Perhaps if these products had been developed with more input from their customers and market research, they would probably have been more successful.

The problem may have been the speed of development, the lake of customer focus, the market changing too quickly. There may have been a combination of factors the contributed to this happening.

In today's competitive world, the company must adapt to the software process depending on the type of development. 

According to the (Chaos Report 2015), only 36% of projects are successful, 43% are more expensive than estimated, and 82% take longer than expected. These numbers motivated the signatories of the agile manifest to meet in 2001 to discuss best practices to reduce such numbers.
